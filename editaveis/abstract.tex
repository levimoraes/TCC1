\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
   The contracting of software is a common practice within the Brazilian Public Organs. At the moment the company wins the bid for a service, the company will have the right to contract, to render the service to the contracting entity. This work aims to propose a dashboard that, with the help of visual resources, is a tool that helps in the process of contracting software in Public Bodies. For this solution, dashboard works as a tool for visualizing indicators, as determined by the Public Organ Project Manager. The dashboard displays the indicators of the projects being developed by the Employer to the Manager. The work consisted of two phases: Initiation and Execution. The objective of the first step is to establish fundamentals (theoretical and architectural) for the Execution phase, while the focus of the second phase is on the implementation of the solution. We chose to use Scrum as an agile development methodology, but some changes were necessary, mainly due to the scope and size of the team. The results achieved so far are more focused on collecting the metrics using the SonarQube software, and displaying, graphically, the data on a web page.
